                    <p>An educational field trip would be an understatement to describe the Out  Bound Training Programme of ABC, which was conducted at the National Youth Corps Training Center, Arangala, Naula in Matale from the 13th –
                    15th of July,2019. This programme went on to take an ‘edu-ventural’  approach, stimulating and nurturing soft skills such as leadership, interpersonal, team building and communication skills among other soft skills through various entertainingly beneficial tasks and activities<br>

                    The prime objective of this programme was to encourage students to move out of their comfort zones and develop their own strategies of interacting and adopting to any given situation, giving them a glimpse of the real rat race of a world out there,and equipping them with the necessary skills to be among the well-rounded candidates with the <br>
                    ability to take on any social or corporate situation head on. The conclusion of this programme was indeed a brilliant sight of happy motivated faces of the students with the look of pure contentment and eagerness to apply the skills accumulated during their training
